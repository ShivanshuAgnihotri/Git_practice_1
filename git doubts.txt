Git repository cloning issue- changes made to repo on git hub are not getting reflected in the already sync local repo
local branch created and merged with master using git bash shows the merged changes in master in github but not the newly created branch
Can a local folder be first created and then using git bash be used as repo in github?
when to use git init?
